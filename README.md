# AI-Based Natural Disaster Prediction and Management System

This project is a comprehensive multi-phase initiative aimed at predicting and managing natural disasters using cutting-edge technologies including Artificial Intelligence, IoT, GIS, and Blockchain. It provides real-time alerts, data-driven insights, and resilient communication systems to enhance disaster preparedness and response.

## Project Overview

Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones cause extensive loss of life and property every year. Our system is designed to reduce these impacts through intelligent prediction, real-time monitoring, multilingual alerting, and robust infrastructure support, especially in rural and high-risk zones.
